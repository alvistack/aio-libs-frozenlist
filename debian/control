Package: python3-frozenlist
Architecture: amd64
Description: List-like structure implements collections.abc.MutableSequence
 The list is mutable until FrozenList.freeze() is called, after which
 list modifications raise RuntimeError. A FrozenList instance is
 hashable, but only when frozen. Attempts to hash a non-frozen instance
 will result in a RuntimeError exception.
